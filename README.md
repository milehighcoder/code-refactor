## Project Description

This application is a simple landing page for a pseudo marketing agency. This company offers full service web development for clients including: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. Essentially, they help clients improve their online presence.

The primary goal of this project was to improve the accessibility of the application while maintaining the functionality and styling that was already in place. There were no feature additions requested by the agency. This was one hundred percent an "under the hood" update.

## Challenge #1 - Updated HTML/CSS with Semantic Elements
The first challenge presented to me was replacing the 'div' elements with more legibal 'semantic' elements for accessibility purposes. This took me some time to figure out as this was my first experience performing this task. One of the biggest things I learned through this challenge was that there are more ways than one to write certain lines of code.

## Challenge #2 - Consolidated CSS Classes

There were many repeat classes that took up unnecessary space on the original stylesheet so I consolidated the stylesheet from around 200 lines to 137 lines (with comments). This was the BIGGEST challenge for me on this project. I got lost several times going back and forth between the CSS and HTML trying to figure out which classes were being tagged where in the HTML. Though this was very time consuming, it really helped me to understand, in great detail, how HTML and CSS stylesheets work together more clearly.

## Conclusion

This was a fun project all around as It challenged my problem solving and googling skills to the max. I feel that I did a great job for the pseudo agency and believe that they would be very happy with the improved accessibility of the application and make the life of the next coder who works on their site much easier!
